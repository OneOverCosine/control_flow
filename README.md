# Control Flow
- if, else, elif
- for loops
- while loops

## Conditional Statements
Use conditionals to run code you only want to execute under certain conditions. They are used to control the flow of your programme.
```python
age = 15 # if the user is above the age of 15 allow them to buy a ticket

if age > 15:
    print("You purchased a ticket!")
elif age <= 15:
    print("You're too young to buy a ticket.")
else:
    print("Something went wrong...") # this will execute if none of the other conditions are met

```
Outputs ``You're too young to buy a ticket.``

## Loops!
